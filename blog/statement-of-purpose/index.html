            </div>
          <div class="content-body">
            <p>Your statement of purpose is an integral part of your application process to study abroad. Quite simply, before actually interviewing you, the school would like to know if you would actually make a great addition to their campus. So, it’s an interview that you will be giving, except via a written monologue, as it may be. </p>
				<h5>Writing the SOP</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>What are the specific academic and professional qualities you possess that could help you excel within this program?</li>
					<li>Why did you choose this particular program?</li>
					<li>What is your motivation to settle for this course or educational/career pathway?</li>
					<li>What led you to choose the country as the destination?</li>
					<li>What goals do you hope to achieve if you are accepted into this program?</li>
				</ul>
				<p> </p>
				<p>At the risk of stating the obvious, answer the questions and you will have a rough outline for the statement of purpose ought to look like. Write it as if you would tell a story, keeping your resume in mind. Don’t forget to pepper your ‘story’ with an anecdote, especially if you want to highlight a specific skill, milestone or event that was a turning point for you. </p>
				<h5>Toot your own horn!</h5>
				<p>I always tell the students, who shudder at the effusive adjectives that I encourage them to use in their SOP’s. At this, I simply draw a correlation to the wonderful letters of recommendation that the professors have written for them. If they can write and recommend you, you must market yourself, twice as much, if you want that admit! Remember that the university has a limited number of seats and there will be many contenders, who would be putting their best foot forward to cinch that admission! Remember here that even if you are not the top scorer in class, you can offset it by highlighting your learning from the program and peg that to a future goal or benchmark that you can achieve. If possible, mention what held you back and your steps to overcome any such obstacle. At this stage, I suggest that you do not delete any of the sentences that you write, write anything and everything that comes to mind! The editing process, I will go into later. </p>
				<h5>Recall value!</h5>
				<p>Remember that your SOP must be memorable, in a good way. It must convey a sense of purpose and meaning to the reader and so, you will need to storyboard. Map your life, age wise if needed, beginning at age 10, if there’s something that’s recall worthy. If not, begin at age 15, where you would have taken your matriculation boards and then again at 17, when you’d complete your 12th. Recall how you chose Arts over Commerce or decided to do a diploma because you didn’t make the cut to VJTI. All these instances will shape your experiences and will convey your decision making process and help the admissions committee build a psychological profile for you. Don’t simply detail your achievements or actions, they would have read your resume and known what you did. You need to explain why you made certain decisions, what makes you tick!</p>
				<h5>Skills Mapping</h5>
				<p>You may wish to include examples of both academic and professional achievements, instead of vaguely hinting to ‘expertise’, ‘skills’ and adeptness. If you do claim to be an expert, you need to give an example of a demonstration of this expertise, so the reader can consider this as a credible testimonial. A tip would be that recent college graduates may want to focus on academic qualifications, while those with work experience will emphasize their professional skills. </p>
				<h5>Seamless narrative!</h5>
				<p>The final question listed in the statement of purpose guidelines asks about additional qualities that make you ‘an ideal candidate overall.’ Admission committees holistically evaluate each applicant’s academic history, professional qualifications, letters of recommendation, and other application materials before admitting any student and the statement of purpose must accentuate all of these credentials with a self-affirmation. </p>
				<h5>Cropping the Edits!</h5>
				<p>This section will draw attention to the manner in which the statement of purpose needs to be shape up. Stick to the rules of grammar! If you are applying to British or European universities, remember that the ‘z’ is replaced by the ‘s’ and vice versa, for the American universities. Also, you could seek the help of a friend, family member, whose writing skills you admire. Keep the storyline free of clutter, avoid meandering from one anecdote to another, without flow. Also, do not deviate from the subject at hand, which is to elaborate on your suitability for admission by recounting that wild summer trip to Manali or any such incident, that may well, ruin your credibility. Humor may well be used for effect but not as a standalone measure of relief. </p>
				<h5>A second opinion saves the day!</h5>
				<p>After you have edited the flab, be sure to circulate your ready draft to your close family and elders, none of whom should be contenders for the same admit as you are. Statements of purposes are expected to be unique and two students with the same SOP will raise an alarm for the institute. Nonetheless, trust your immediate family and have them give constructive feedback on your written piece. Once you have the collective feedback, see if there are any common errors that have been pointed out and correct them. For the other errors, if they’re factual or grammatical, do change them. If they are only for effect, see if you could perhaps draft the sentence better, in your own way. Is that done? There, you are now set to send off your application with your own original statement of purpose. All the best!</p>
