            <p>The Republic of Ireland is a part of the British Isles replete in Gaelic culture, food and tradition, which is most commonly depicted across the globe in the form of Saint Patrick - one of Ireland&#39;s patron saints and of course, the four leaved clover, leprechauns and of course, faeries. Ireland also happens to be one of the countries in the European Union to recognize English as an official language, which has given it the edge over other countries in Europe and for international students, it is a haven as they can safely practice the language (if they’re not experts anyways) for the Irish are as jolly and cheerful as they seem.</p>
				<p>The education structure in Ireland has three levels – primary school, secondary school and tertiary (university) . Some of the top universities for international students in Ireland are Trinity College (Dublin), University College (Dublin), National University of Ireland (Galway), and University College of Cork with most of the finest Irish Universities being located in Dublin, Ireland. In fact, Dublin has a moniker “The University City”, which only shows why it is the fastest growing city in Ireland today. The education system in Ireland is regulated by the government universities autonomously while the Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) is the national accreditation body that assesses and awards rankings to the higher education programs in private institutions.</p>
				<p>The number of international students opting for Ireland as a top destination for tertiary education has significantly increased, with Chinese students easily outnumbering other country’s representation as per a study conducted by the European Migration Network. Aside from China, Malaysia, America, Canada, India, and Saudi Arabia are the countries whose students opt for the Irish education system. This trend also has to do with the Irish universities aggressively marketing themselves at education fairs, all across the globe. The reason being that the rise in technology and development means a fair cash flow must be maintained and with in-state resident tuition, the domestic students do not contribute more than 24% of the expenses. The remainder must come from other sources, so international students bring in valuable foreign exchange, providing a fiscal bolus to the Irish GDP.</p>
				<p>The number of international students coming to Ireland increased by 45 per cent between 2013 and 2017 with over 13,500 residence permits that have been issued to international students coming to study in Ireland. One may also refer to the Irish Council for International Students for information on the options that Ireland has to offer for international students by clicking on the link https://www.internationalstudents.ie/info-and-advice here.</p>
				<h5>Top 5 Reasons to Study in Ireland</h5>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Excellent infrastructure and Top Universities:</b><br />All or Ireland&#39;s Universities are in the top 5% globally. The economic impact of Ireland’s seven universities is estimated at €8.9bn per annum, according to what is claimed by Indecon to be the first socioeconomic impact research undertaken on the role Irish universities play in the economy of the country. The report revealed that the seven universities generate €386m a year in export earnings and €1.5bn in research &amp; development, which means having the best of talent, top-notch hardware and technology resources and centers for excellence. With infrastructure like this, every student in the STEM fields would naturally gravitate towards Ireland as the education destination of choice.</li>
					<li><b>International Student Scholarships:</b><br />The Republic of Ireland has an outstanding scholarship program for international students where each scholarship is based on specific criteria as set by the individual institutions in Ireland. For example, Dublin Institute of Technology (DIT) offers a Centenary Scholarship Programme for all international students pursuing a graduate program at the institution. Similarly, the National University of Ireland in Galway (NUIG) offers several scholarships specifically for Indian students, such as the Max Arthur Macauliffe Special Merit Scholarship, and the Sir Peter Freyer Special Merit Scholarship. Also, the Irish Chamber of Commerce and the Indian Chamber of Commerce also have special focal scholarships for students choosing to train in fields like Management, Finance and Accounting. Needless to say, the more meritorious the student, the better the scholarship. Ireland is competing in the world arena to attracting the biggest and brightest talent and what better way than to entice them with all-paid-for education!</li>
					<li><b>Safe haven for international students:</b><br />The Irish are some of the happiest people you’ll ever meet. Whether you’re at the pub, enjoying a spring concert in the park or just walking down the road, everyone smiles warmly and seem to radiate bonhomie. Being a foreigner will make you feel more welcome and at home, as the Irish are big on family and celebrations and they love to swap noted with visitors. Indian’s especially will really like these celebrations are they will remind you of the rambunctious Punjabi or the raucous Gujarati do’s. Especially in Dublin, whichis home to many renowned universities and is home to a large international student population. Most international students praise Dublin’s particularly friendly environment, great nightlife and global diversity, a big draw for international students looking for a great opportunity to explore a growing city. Also, where there’s a hearty crowd there goes the pub culture and it is a safe city to walk around past dusk as well with an active law enforcement.</li>
					<li><b>MNC hub - Silicon Valley of Europe:</b><br />Companies like Google, Amazon, Apple, and Facebook have headquarters in the Island nation, apart from Ireland&#39;s own homegrown organizations like CRH, DCC, and Kerry group. EU headquarters of nearly all top IT and Pharmaceutical giants are in Ireland. It also includes Indian companies such as Infosys and TCS. Ireland has become famous as the ‘Silicon Valley of Europe’ and where there is business, money follows. The Irish Banking system has a host of home grown and international banks like the Allied Irish Banks, Bank of America, Bank of Ireland, Bank of Montreal, Barclays Bank etc.</li>
					<li><b>Work opportunities:</b><br />International students can work in Ireland for upto 2 years after finishing their Masters. For undergraduate students, the work visa duration is 1 year. During the work period, should students secure a job with annual package of Euro 30000, they qualify to extend their work permit and qualify to apply for a Green Card. International students registered for full-time accredited courses need not have an additional work permit to work in the country, apart from proper documentation to be able to gain employment. According to Education Ireland&#39;s official portal, all international students with a valid immigration stamp 2 are permitted to work upto 40 hour a week in Ireland, between June to September and from 15th December to 15th January. During the rest of the year, international students holding the valid work document can work upto 20 hours/week. All students are allowed to work till the expiration of the Immigration permission Stamp 2. So for Indian students, it is a win-win situation when opting for Ireland, especially for those who seek fresh pastures and a way to gain access to Europe’s fastest growing economy. As a student, you have the time to familiarize yourself with the culture, society and gain your bearings. So don’t wait, call us at _________ now to apply to Irish universities for a discipline of your choosing.</li>
