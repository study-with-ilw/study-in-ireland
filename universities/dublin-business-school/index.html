    <p>Dublin Business School (DBS) is the leading independent third-level college in Ireland and provides a comprehensive range of undergraduate, postgraduate, professional and executive education programmes. Formerly known as Accountancy and Business College, DBS was established in 1975 to provide</p>
				<p>evening programmes for students preparing for the examinations of the professional accountancy bodies. The College quickly established an excellent reputation for quality and standards and its students achieved a high level of success in the professional examinations. Based on this reputation, the College developed rapidly and by the mid 1980s was providing professional accounting, marketing and banking programmes for both full and part-time students..</p>
				<p>In 1989 the College introduced its first undergraduate degree programme under a franchise arrangement with Liverpool John Moores University (LJMU). The academic relationship between the two institutions has developed and strengthened over the years. DBS became an Accredited Institution of LJMU in 1995 and now offers a range of programmes leading to honours degree and postgraduate awards. DBS complies fully with LJMU quality assurance procedures and conducts periodic programmatic reviews in line with LJMU policies and requirements. An academic representative from LJMU is a member of the DBS Academic Board.</p>
				<p>Dublin Business School became a designated institution with HETAC (formerly the National</p>
				<p>Council for Educational Awards) in 1992. The School initially offered a number of programmes leading to awards at National Certificate level. The relationship with HETAC has expanded over the years and programmes offered now include honours degrees and higher diplomas. In 1999 Dublin Business School acquired LSB College and became the largest independent third-level college in Ireland. The primary academic focus and strength of LSB College lay in the field of arts and humanities and</p>
				<p>the acquisition provided the basis for the development of what is now the DBS School of Arts.</p>
				<p>In March 2006, DBS acquired the European Business School (EBS). EBS was founded in 1993 and is a member of the EBSI group, a collective group of eight independent business schools located throughout Europe. EBS offers a variety of undergraduate and postgraduate courses for ‘study abroad’ students and provides DBS with an entry into a broader European market</p>
